                    Good health and wellness are primarily determined by what we eat,
                    what we exercise, and when we sleep. Eating healthfully, in addition
                    to good exercises, creates a good effect on the conditions for
                    learning. Students find it challenging to focus on exercises and
                    healthy food as they are stressful with their tight schedules and
                    activities. Still, it’s more important for students to maintain our
                    health. Fortunately, a nutritionist, Ms. McDonald who works with
                    many universities, suggests a few things we can do to eat healthily
                    and stay in shape;
                </p>
                <ul class="health">
                    <li>
                        We should buy and stock healthy snacks and easy meals in the dorm
                        or our backpack. These healthy snacks such as trail mix, whole
                        fruit, whole-grain granola bars, chocolate milk, yogurt, string
                        cheese, or whole-grain cracker can be found at The Corner’s Stone
                        and Global Village market. You can buy them with your dining
                        dollar!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We should always stay hydrated; we can use a reusable water
                        bottle. Drinking soft drinks should be avoided.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We should always look for nutrient-dense instead of calorie-dense
                        when we go through a menu at restaurants on campus. We should
                        include vegetables, fruits, and whole grains with every meal we
                        order.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Find spare time for your exercise. Partake in any gym activities
                        such as basketball or cycling.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Here are two online resources that help you stay in good health and
                    fit. Some of the pieces of information include ways for you to track
                    your intake nutrition progress.
