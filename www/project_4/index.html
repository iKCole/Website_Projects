            Being successful in college is more than just getting good grades.
            Student Life Hack is dedicated to helping students build a
            productive habit while being at college, which in turn leads them
            into a beautiful life when graduating. It also aims to cover common
            issues students have and offer practical suggestions in order to
            help them become successful students in RIT. <br /><br />These are
            the four main focuses on this topic: best study tips, financial best
            practices, staying healthy, and new lifestyles
          </p>

          <p>

                >&quot;Study Best Tips&quot;</a
              ></span
            >
            students learn hacks and tips that they can use to learn
            effectively, spend less time studying, use resources available at
            RIT, and become more productive in college.

                >financial best practices</a
              ></span
            >&comma; students learn to develop their financial skills, budgets
            and use useful apps that track their spending habits. This topic
            also provides some tips on how to avoid being in a lifetime debt to
            the school.

          <p>
            <span><a href="../project_4/health.html">Stay healthy</a></span> in
            college should be as easy as RIT provides health care and endless
            physical activities for students. This topic is to help students
            find activities as their exercises and learn to make the most of the
            health resources at RIT here.
          </p>

          <p>
            <span><a href="../project_4/life.html">Extra lifestyle</a></span> is
            about giving practical tips for what students can do to enjoy
            off-campus. It includes finding extracurricular activities to join
            and learning ASL. These topic sentences are more of categories that
            I might add more related articles and facts for each.
