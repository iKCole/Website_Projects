                    <span class="letter">I</span> am Isaac Coleman, but you can call me either Ike or Zac. My parents
                    prefer calling me those instead of my name, Isaac. I am from Ghana, one of the most peaceful
                    countries in Africa. I moved to Virginia with my family a few years ago. I am a sophomore and sort
                    of double majoring in Computing Information and Technology at RIT as well as Applied Computing and
                    Technology at NTID. I prefer communicating in Sign Language and English Written.

                    Let me tell you about my recent experience here. I went to the Black Creed river after Ballantyne
                    School. I went going on a walk along a lake. It was 32 degrees in temperature and the precipitation
                    during that moment was slightly about 0.2 in. I happened to see small ripples in the lake and felt
                    at peace watching those ripples. seeing a peaceful nature made me feel alive and calm as if my
                    stress went away. I will try to spend time going into the bush nearby every weekend if the weather
                    allows me.

                    Being successful in college is more than just getting good grades. My project titled &quot;Student
                    Life Hack&quot; is dedicated to helping students build a
                    productive habit while being at college, which in turn leads them
                    into a beautiful life when graduating. It also aims to cover common
                    issues students have at college, and offers practical suggestions in order for them to become
                    successful students in RIT.

                    Throughout this project of building a website, there were things I did or improved, and there were also things I still struggle with. Creating a basic responsive design for desktop and tablet was not as tricky as designing a responsive one for mobile-friendly. I had more frustrating trouble on how to hide horizontal navigation into a small box with a vertical slide side. I also struggled with a grid layout for different devices and using a media query to switch layouts between devices. There were things I improved over a period, such as how to add more titles into a dropdown menu in navigation instead of forcing names within its horizontal box.
