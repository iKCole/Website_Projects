            <p>Every time I go to dance club, I only see the fun, relaxing and spirituality in activities with different styles. At first, I was nervous as I was afraid of being a bad or embarrassed dancer.  But now I have started to see my confidence in myself as I try hard to learn and practice with you. I don’t feel embarrassed at all, although I know I don’t dance well compared to you. You are nearly perfect in dancing. You have great posture which allow you to move in a way that is so pleasing to the eye of every student here. I do not confide in feeling the same way you show. Sure, I do believe students coming for the session often can become a dancer regardless of their body shapes and proportions. But our trust can be blinded by seeing someone dancing with their sparking confidence.</p>

            The first time I began learning to dance was when I saw a movie with Michael Jackson the first time. watching the movies with Jackson playing always hook me up that I could not resist trying to copy his dance style. Eventually I saw no point in continuing this dance because my body would never move the way I wanted to follow in my mind. I could not get more control of my body. I guess mastering dance skills takes time, patience, and natural sensual connection between mind and body. Until I joined this club, and with the instructor showing how to move the body as we dance, I began to see the improvement on my body moving as I learned to be able to gain little control of my body. I learned how to dance the proper way by imitating white attempting to adjust any style I like. The feeling of seeing myself dance is really a good experience. I know I don’t dance well, Yet I see  myself that I improve better compared to the first time  I danced. This is one of reasons why I try not to miss every session and I want to have this experience again and again.

            Everyone may think dance club is all about moving the body in connection of sounds or vibrations as well as for those who have talents or skills. However, I think dancing is more than just moving the bodies. It’s about us learning to build self-confidence, improving flexibility and strength. Also, it’s about exploring various styles with natural senses and exercising both the body and mind.If you would like to join any activity that de-stress your stress, I recommend going to dance club. I promise you won’t be bored anymore, and you will feel alive and energized for your assignments after session.
