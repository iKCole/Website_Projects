            <p>Good health and wellness are primarily determined by what we eat, what we exercise, and when we sleep. Eating healthfully, in addition to good exercises, creates a good effect on the conditions for learning. Students find it challenging to focus on exercises and healthy food as they are stressful with their tight schedules and activities. Still, it’s more important for students to maintain our health. Fortunately, a nutritionist, Ms. McDonald who works with many universities, suggests a few things we can do to eat healthily and stay in shape;
                </p>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            We should buy and stock healthy snacks and easy meals in the dorm or our backpack. These healthy snacks such as trail mix, whole fruit, whole-grain granola bars, chocolate milk, yogurt, string cheese, or whole-grain cracker can be found at The Corner’s Stone and Global Village market. You can buy them with your dining dollar!
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            We should always stay hydrated; we can use a  reusable water bottle. Drinking soft drinks should be avoided.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            We should always look for nutrient-dense instead of calorie-dense when we go through a menu at restaurants on campus. We should include vegetables, fruits, and whole grains with every meal we order.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Find spare time for your exercise. Partake in any gym activities such as basketball or cycling.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                    Here are two online resources that help you stay in good health and fit. Some of the pieces of information include ways for you to track your intake nutrition progress.
