            <p>Every student I know, including myself, wants to be more a financially responsible person who knows where the money goes. So, what’s the best practical way to do this? You guess it right; it’s a budget! What are some good ways for students to track their budgets?
                <br><br>
            The <a href="https://cents-ability.org/portfolio/50-30-20-rule/" target="_blank">50/30/20</a> plan divides your paycheck into three percent of your budget This budget method is excellent for you because it helps show how much money you put into different needs. It helps you manage to justify the money you spend. The following percents for 50/30/20 are:
            <dl>
                <dt>Essential expense</dt>
                <dd>50% of your money goes towards things like apartment rent, groceries, transportation, indispensable utilities, insurance if necessary.</dd>
                <dt>Personal wants</dt>
                <dd>30% of your paycheck: this portion goes towards the wants Like clothes, monthly subscription, entertainment, and eating out. This part is extra, where you want to spend without worrying about being broke.</dd>
                <dt>Financial priorities</dt>
                <dd>We know saving is vital for us to prepare for a future emergency and avoid taking on future debt. 20% of your paycheck goes towards saving, investing, and student loan debts.</dd>
            </dl>
            This method is what I am currently using and so far I’m happy with how it’s going. The portions of each budget category are flexible. You can adjust these portions for your situation if needed. For instance, you might want to increase the percent for your savings and decrease the percent for your personal wants. However, you need to make sure to address important needs because some portions such as the rent, insurance are almost fixed. 
            <br><br>
            If you’re down for budgeting using this method and want to do the calculation, 
            take a look at a <a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/finance/nerdwallet-budget-calculator/" target="_blank">free budget calculator</a>  published by Nerdwallet, a financial company with students in mind, that details this method. If you are like me who wants to manage the budget with some fixed goals, check out an <a href="https://personalfinance.duke.edu/monitor-track-your-progress" target="_blank"> article on budgeting</a> by Personal Finance at Duke, a group of financial advisors at Duke University.
