            <p>Being successful in college is more than just getting good grades. Student Life Hack is dedicated to helping students build a productive habit while being at college, which in turn leads them into a beautiful life when graduating. It also aims to cover common issues students have and offer practical suggestions in order to help them become successful students in RIT. These are the four main focuses on this topic: best study tips, financial best practices, staying healthy, and new lifestyles</p>
            <p>With the topic “Study Best Tips,” students learn hacks and tips that they can use to learn effectively, spend less time studying, use resources available at RIT, and become more productive in college.<br><br>
            With financial best practices, students learn to develop their financial skills, budgets and use useful apps that track their spending habits. This topic also provides some tips on how to avoid being in a lifetime debt to the school.
            </p>

            <p>Staying healthy in college should be as easy as RIT provides health care and endless physical activities for students. This topic is to help students find activities as their exercises and learn to make the most of the health resources at RIT here. <br><br>
            Extra lifestyle is about giving practical tips for what students can do to enjoy off-campus. It includes finding extracurricular activities to join and learning ASL.
            These topic sentences are more of categories that I might add more related articles and facts for each.
