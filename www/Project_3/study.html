            <p>We all know every student, including myself, has their own way of studying and retaining information, including spending long hours of studying, cramming weeks into a very short amount of time before exams. However, research shows that successful students actually spend less time studying, but study more effectively. Sounds incredible and interesting? Have we wondered if we have learned the wrong way or why we seem to struggle when studying?</p>
            <p>The following are some effective practices for studying: </p>
            <dl>
                <dt>Avoid multitasking</dt>
                <dd>Killing two birds with one stone is not a big problem for us, students. After all, technologies have taken roles in our lives. We can watch videos on mobile phones while eating and text while studying. That said, we are actually developing this bad study habit because we shouldn’t multitask when studying.</dd>
                <dt>Use Mind Maps</dt>
                <dd>Of course, many students like me find visual elements helpful for studying and remembering topics. If you are one of the visual learners like me, it’s likely you are already using the mind maps. If not, you too might find summarizing your notes visually to be helpful. The technique of mind mapping is easy to learn. There are many Youtube tutorials to help you get started.” Moreover, there are many apps available, that you can use on your phone, tablet or desktop computer.</dd>
                <dt>Teach others</dt>
                <dd>teaching new materials to others is one of my favorite study methods. Teaching is a beautiful way to get a full understanding of the topic. If you have a friend or classmate whom you study with or someone having trouble understanding the materials, we suggest you offer to study with them and teach them. You will find  that you, yourself understand the subject better and may discover answers to questions you had in class.</dd>
                <dt>Improve your time management skills</dt>
                <dd>We struggle with balancing part-time work, class courses, responsibilities, and club meetings at RIT/NTID. Without planning ahead for these activities, we can become overwhelmed and therefore less successful in college. Thanks to modern technologies, we can use some planner apps that allow us to organize our study more effectively. </dd>
                <dt>Find tutors</dt>
                <dd></dd>
            </dl>
            <p>Remember to put yourself first, as <a href="https://www.rit.edu/studentaffairs/asc/online/blog/2018/01/time-management-tips-busy-students" target="_blank">Emily Griffin, the RIT student</a>, who wrote about how she managed times at college, advises that we make sure we include ourselves in that planning. She advises that we make time to eat healthily, take breaks, and sleep enough.
